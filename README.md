Python framework for artificial text detection:
NLP approaches to compare natural text against generated by neural networks.




### Contents

This work has the extensive documentation which is divided into following parts:

- [ATD framework](docs/framework.md). This section is about the general way to detect artificial texts.
  It consists of the overview of end-to-end pipelines list for this task.
- [Data](docs/data.md). Textual domains were aggregated in the specific way.
  This section describes the generative part of the task.
- [Discriminator models](docs/models.md). This section describes the discriminative part of the task.

### Installation steps:

We use [`poetry`](https://python-poetry.org/) as a dependency resolver.
```bash
make poetry-download
poetry install --no-dev
```

Make sure that `artificial_detection` library is pre-configured in your environment:
```bash
pip show artificial-detection
```

### Simple run:

To run the artificial text detection classifier, execute the pipeline:

# TODO: improve runners
```bash
python detection/old.py
```


### DVC for prototypes

[DVC](https://dvc.org/) is used to pull and update small- and medium-sized samples into remote storage.
Google Drive has been chosen as a remote storage.
Credentials are hidden. Reach out the maintainer for contributions and prototyping support.
